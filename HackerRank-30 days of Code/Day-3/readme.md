Objective</br>
In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements. </br>

Task</br>
Given an integer, n , perform the following conditional actions:</br>

If n is odd, print Weird</br>
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird</br>
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird</br>
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird</br>
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.</br>

Input Format</br>

A single line containing a positive integer,n .</br>

Constraints</br>
1<=n<=100</br>
Output Format</br>

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.</br>

Sample Input 0</br>

3</br>
Sample Output 0</br>

Weird</br>
Sample Input 1</br>

24</br>
Sample Output 1</br>

Not Weird</br>
Explanation</br>

Sample Case 0:n=3 </br>
n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.</br>

Sample Case 1:n=24 </br>
n>20 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.</br>
