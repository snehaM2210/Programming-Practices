Objective
</br></br>
Today, we're working with Binary Search Trees (BSTs). 
</br></br>
Task
</br></br>
The height of a binary search tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. You are given a pointer, root, pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the getHeight function provided in your editor so that it returns the height of the binary search tree.
</br></br>
Input Format
</br></br>
The locked stub code in your editor reads the following inputs and assembles them into a binary search tree:</br>
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.</br>
Each of the n subsequent lines contains an integer, data, denoting the value of an element that must be added to the BST.
</br></br>
Output Format
</br></br>
The locked stub code in your editor will print the integer returned by your getHeight function denoting the height of the BST.

Sample Input
</br></br>
7</br>
3</br>
5</br>
2</br>
1</br>
4</br>
6</br>
7</br>
</br>
Sample Output
</br></br>
3</br>
</br>
Explanation
</br></br>
There are 4 nodes in this path that are connected by 3 edges, meaning our BST's height=3. Thus, we print 3 as our answer.</br>
