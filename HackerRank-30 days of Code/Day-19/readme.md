Today, we're learning about Interfaces. </br>
</br>
Task</br>
The AdvancedArithmetic interface and the method declaration for the abstract divisorSum(n) method are provided for you in the editor below.</br>
</br>
Complete the implementation of Calculator class, which implements the AdvancedArithmetic interface. The implementation for the divisorSum(n) method must return the sum of all divisors of n.</br>
</br>
Input Format</br>
</br>
A single line containing an integer, n.</br>
</br>
Constraints</br>
1<=n<=1000</br>
</br>
Output Format</br>
</br>
You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. The locked template code in the editor below will call your code and print the necessary output.</br>
</br>
Sample Input</br>
</br>
6</br>
</br>
Sample Output</br>
</br>
I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic</br>
12</br>
</br>
Explanation</br>
</br>
The integer 6 is evenly divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6. Our divisorSum method should return the sum of these numbers, which is 1+2+3+6=12. The Solution class then prints I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic on the first line, followed by the sum returned by divisorSum (which is 12) on the second line.
