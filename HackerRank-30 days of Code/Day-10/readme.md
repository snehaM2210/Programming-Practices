Objective</br>
Today, we're working with binary numbers. </br>
Task</br>
Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation.</br>

Input Format</br>

A single integer, n.</br>

Constraints</br>
1<=n<=10^6</br>

Output Format</br>

Print a single base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of n.</br>

Sample Input 1</br>
5</br>

Sample Output 1</br>
1</br>

Sample Input 2</br>
13</br>

Sample Output 2</br>
2</br>

Explanation</br>

Sample Case 1:</br>
The binary representation of 5 is 101, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 1.</br>

Sample Case 2:</br>
The binary representation of 13 is 1101, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 2.</br>
